# Cooking Realm Web Development Project

This project involves creating a backend system where users can share and browse recipes. You need to implement user roles (regular users and administrators), with users able to post recipes, comment, and rate them. Recipes should have categories, ingredients, cooking instructions, and nutritional information.
